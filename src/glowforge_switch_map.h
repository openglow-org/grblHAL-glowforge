  glowforge_switch_map.h - the pure EV_SW bit -> control-signal mapping

  Part of grblHAL-glowforge. Split from glowforge_switches.c so the
  host unit test (tests/switch_map_test.c) can exercise the exact
  decode the controller gates motion on - a polarity flip here would
  make a Pro's remote interlock read satisfied-while-open.

/* The control signals the core should see, given its state. This is the
   single policy behind both hal.control.get_state() and the edge
   delivery: the safety-door signal is withheld while the core is IDLE,
   JOG or HOMING and shown as-is in every other state. Rationale: the beam
   is blocked in hardware whenever the lid or the interlock loop is open;
   the lid is opened at idle every time material is loaded; and a door the
   core sees while idle - at boot, on a stop, or as an edge - strands the
   controller in Door until a cycle start. In a running or held job, a
   tool change, or an existing door state the signal is live, so a job
   started with the lid open parks on the first poll and a mid-job open
   parks exactly as before. */
