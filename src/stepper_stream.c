/*
  stepper_stream.c - pulse-stream stepper engine for the Glowforge board

  Part of grblHAL-glowforge. This module is the step "timer": it turns
  grblHAL stepper events directly into the kernel pulse-byte stream.

  Contract (the pulse feeder contract,
  https://docs.forgefirm.org/technical/forgefirm/pulse-feeder-contract/):
  one byte per machine tick (kernel step_freq); velocity is
  step density; byte layout bit0 X_STEP, bit1 X_DIR (set = -X), bit2
  Y_STEP, bit3 Y_DIR (set = +Y), bit5 Z_STEP, bit6 Z_DIR (set = +Z, lens
  up); streaming=1 while live-feeding (underrun is fault-like), cleared
  before the terminal end-of-data; the fd stays open and flock'd for the
  process lifetime (kernel dead man's switch).

  Laser (bit 4 FIRE + bit-7 power bytes): the producer records power/
  fire transitions on the same tick grid as the steps (gf_stream_laser,
  called from the core's per-segment spindle update under the core
  lock); the shipper applies them as it emits - a power byte
  (0x80 | duty) ahead of the first tick byte the transition covers,
  then the FIRE bit OR'd into every tick byte while fire is on.
  Contract rules handled here: a power byte costs NO machine tick (the
  SDMA script processes the following byte in the same EPIT interrupt,
  so power bytes are extra stream bytes that leave the tick/due math
  untouched); consecutive power bytes would be dropped by the script
  (transitions are coalesced per tick, so a power byte always has a
  tick byte directly behind it); and every plain run start resets the
  hardware duty to ~100%, so a power byte leads every kernel run before
  any fire bit can occur. Arming policy lives in glowforge_laser.c: the
  kernel laser latch stays locked except inside an operator-armed job
  window, and while armed an underrun faults instead of the stop/run
  retry (a restarted run resets the duty - queued fire bits would
  replay at ~full power).

  Threading model (three actors):

  - The grbl protocol thread runs the planner and calls the hal.stepper
    entry points below via driver.c (always under the recursive core
    lock).
  - The PRODUCER thread: while armed it runs
    hal.stepper.interrupt_callback() under the core
    lock, advances a virtual clock (hal.f_step_timer = 1000 x machine
    tick) by the latched cycles_per_tick, and maps each pulse event onto
    the byte grid (exact /1000). It is wall-clock paced to stay within
    [wall, wall + ~2 ms]: the core's internal segment lookahead is only
    ~40-90 ms and is refilled from the protocol thread, so production
    must not run ahead of real time (the queue depth is supplied by pad
    PRELOAD, not by producing early).
  - The SHIPPER thread (SCHED_FIFO when permitted) writes due bytes to
    /dev/glowforge every ~10 ms (due = wall-elapsed x rate + depth, per
    the UAPI pacing rule) and owns the kernel state machine: run start,
    underrun ack/retry, streaming=1/0, and the PIC run/hold current
    switching (hold applied only after the kernel has drained its queue
    and idled - the decel tail lives there).

  Lock order is strictly core -> gf. The shipper takes only gf.lock and
  NEVER calls core APIs; stream faults are surfaced through an atomic
  flag polled by the protocol thread's realtime hook.

  Without GFSINK the module runs in null-sink mode: producer, ring and
  shipper all operate identically but no device/sysfs I/O happens -
  used for hardware-less protocol/motion verification.

 * live in the userspace ring and gf_stream_reset discards them (with their
