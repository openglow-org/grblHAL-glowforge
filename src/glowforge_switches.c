/*
  The machine's switches arrive as EV_SW bits on a gpio-keys input device.
  State is read with EVIOCGSW, never a grab: forgectrl polls the same device
  for the status panel, and the laser arm flow reads the button through
  gfsw_read_raw().

  Two of the bits gate motion, mapped onto the core's safety-door signal
  because that is what they mean - the machine cannot fire:

    doors     (bit 3) inactive  the lid is not closed. This is the series
                                combination the hardware safety chain itself
                                uses, not the individual door switches.
    interlock (bit 5) active    the remote-interlock loop is OPEN, i.e. the
                                regulatory lockout is engaged. The sense is
                                inverted relative to the door switches;
                                Basic/Plus ship the connector jumpered, so the
                                bit rests inactive there.

  What a job does when one of them opens is the factory firmware's policy
  (lid_policy = cancel, the default): the core parks the job in the door
  state - a planned deceleration with the laser off and the position kept -
  and the moment it is parked the job is CANCELLED: the armed window closes,
  the reason is reported, a soft reset ends the sender's stream (the
  position is not lost - the reset comes from a fully parked state, so no
  alarm), and the head returns on its own to where the job started, lid
  open or not. The next job re-arms with a fresh button press, which is
  the same press the hardware button latch (set by the lid) needs. With
  lid_policy = hold the door parks the job and a cycle start resumes it
  once the lid is closed - stock grblHAL behavior; the hardware still needs
  a button press before the beam returns.

  While the core is IDLE, JOG or HOMING the door signal is deliberately
  hidden from it (gfsw_visible, applied to both get_state() and the edge
  delivery): the lid is opened at idle every time material is loaded, the
  beam is blocked in hardware anyway, and a door seen while idle - at boot,
  on a stop, or as an edge - strands the controller in Door until a cycle
  start. It is also hidden during the return-to-start motion after a
  cancel, which runs with the latch locked. The signal becomes visible, and
  is delivered, the moment the core is in any other state, so a job started
  with the lid open parks (and cancels) on the first poll.

  The button (bit 2) is the operator's consent in the arm flow (the wait
  reads it through gfsw_read_raw()) and, outside the arm wait, the job
  pause/resume toggle: a press while a job runs is a feed hold, a press
  while it is held is a cycle start. A hold has no further meaning.

  Bit 4 (hv_enable) is the readback of the board's HV_ENABLE output, not an
  input: it is low at idle and high only while a run feeds the charge-pump
  watchdog with the lid closed. It is telemetry (forgectrl shows it) and gates
  nothing here; the core's e_stop signal is not wired to anything on this
  hardware.

  Bit 6 (interlock latch tripped) is deliberately not gated on: its resting
  state on a healthy machine is not characterized, and a false assertion would
  wedge every job. The hardware chain enforces it regardless.

  Test hook: with GF_SWITCH_FILE set (and no device, i.e. a null-sink host
  build), the EV_SW word is read from that file instead - an integer,
  decimal or 0x-hex, holding the bitmask exactly as EVIOCGSW would return
  it. The host harnesses use it to open the lid, break the interlock loop
  and press the button against the real gating code.
