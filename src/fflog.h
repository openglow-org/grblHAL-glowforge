 *
 * Every ForgeFIRM process logs through the system syslog socket
 * (/dev/log); rsyslog is the only file writer and routes each program
 * to its own directory under /data/log/forgefirm. This emitter differs
 * from glibc syslog(3) in one deliberate way: the socket is
 * NON-BLOCKING and a message that cannot be queued is dropped and
 * counted. A unix datagram socket exerts backpressure on its sender, so
 * a stalled log daemon could otherwise park a controller thread - on
 * a machine with a laser, a lost log line is the correct failure mode.
 *
 * Levels are the syslog severities (<syslog.h> LOG_ERR .. LOG_DEBUG).
 * The emit level comes from the shared machine config
 * (/data/forgefirm.conf): log_<ident>_disk and log_<ident>_remote,
 * each off|error|warning|notice|info|debug - the process emits at the
 * more verbose of the two and rsyslog filters per destination. Read
 * once at start; a change takes effect at the next process start
 * (in practice: reboot).
 *
 * Messages are echoed to stderr as well when stderr is a terminal or
 * FFLOG_STDERR=1 is set (bench runs, host-side test harnesses); under
 * the supervisor stderr is a pipe into a syslog relay, so no echo.
 * FFLOG_LEVEL overrides the configured level, FFLOG_CONF the config
 * path, FFLOG_SOCK the socket path (host tests against a private
 * rsyslog instance).
 *
 * This file is vendored verbatim into the other ForgeFIRM C daemons
 * (grblHAL-glowforge); keep the copies identical.
