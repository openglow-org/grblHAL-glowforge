/*
  glowforge_laser.c - laser spindle + operator arming for the Glowforge board

  Part of grblHAL-glowforge. Maps grblHAL's laser spindle (M3/M4 + S
  words, $32 laser mode) onto the pulse stream: S values become raw
  7-bit power bytes (the kernel writes them straight into PWMSAR against
  a 127-count period, so the spindle PWM is precomputed to a period of
  exactly 127), and fire rides the per-tick FIRE bit. Power lands via
  the core's per-segment spindle update, which the stepper producer runs
  at exact virtual-tick positions - so the laser only ever fires inside
  motion segments of laser blocks. Jogs, G0 and homing are fire-free by
  construction, and the kernel's end-of-data backstop forces the lines
  low whenever a stream ends.

  ARMING - the operator stays in the loop. FIRE reaches the tube only
  through the hardware AND chain (lid switches, interlock, HV OK, the
  charge-pump watchdog the kernel feeds while a run plays, and the
  BUTTON latch). On the first laser-on of a job this module:

    1. refuses outright while a coolant fire gate is active (flow FAULT
       or over-temperature - glowforge_cooling.c owns the verdicts),
    2. forces the run fan profile on (so flow interrogation covers
       every fire window) and unlocks the kernel laser latch,
    3. lights the button white and BLOCKS the gcode stream - pumping
       real-time traffic like the homing session does - until the
       operator presses the physical button (EV_SW bit 2 on the input
       device), a soft reset aborts, the lid or the interlock loop
       opens (the job is cancelled: relock, alarm), or the timeout
       expires. A press with the lid open does not arm - the hardware
       button latch would not clear on it either.

  The armed window is JOB-based: it persists across the job (S changes
  and M5/M3 toggles do not re-prompt) and closes - relocking the
  latch - at program end (M2/M30/%), whenever the sender's connection
  changes (the consent belonged to the displaced session), after
  laser_disarm_s of spindle-off grace (counting down in Idle and in a
  job parked in Hold, Door or Tool Change - only a cycle, a jog or a
  lingering M3 keeps the window open), or immediately on alarm, homing,
  reset or a stream fault. The coolant fire gate is re-checked after
  the button wait, so a window can never open against a verdict that
  went bad during the wait. While unarmed or gated, fire requests are
  suppressed at the stream and reported.

  Gates, in order, at the first laser-on of a job: the coolant verdict
  (fire_ok), head presence (the head driver has probed - lens, air assist
  and beam detector are on the head), then the operator's button press.

  Config keys (shared machine config, re-read at each arm):
    laser_button_timeout_s   button wait budget (default 300; clamped
                             to 1-3600 - out-of-range values fall back
                             to the default, never wait-forever)
    laser_disarm_s           spindle-off grace before the armed window
                             closes (default 60)
    laser_power_model        density (dose as FIRE-bit density at full
                             duty, the default) or analog (dose as PWM
                             duty). $35 means a different thing in each:
                             a density floor for the first, a duty floor
                             for the second, and the shipped default is
                             the density one - selecting analog means
                             raising $35 to the duty the tube lases at
                             or low S will not fire.
    laser_pulse_ticks        density base period in machine ticks
                             (default 20 = 710 us at 28160 Hz)
    laser_pulse_min_ticks    shortest pulse the density model will emit
                             (default 3 = 106 us). Below it a period is
                             skipped and its debt carried, so a low
                             level arrives as fewer full-width pulses
                             rather than stubs the supply cannot strike.
