/*
  switch_map_test.c - truth table for the EV_SW -> control-signal decode

  Part of grblHAL-glowforge. Host unit test for the exact mapping the
  controller gates motion on (src/glowforge_switch_map.h). The
  polarity facts under test are the shared contract (forgectrl
  switch map, https://docs.forgefirm.org/technical/forgefirm/forgectrl/):

    - doors (bit 3) is active = lid CLOSED (series chain)
    - interlock (bit 5) is INVERTED: active = loop OPEN (lockout);
      a flip here would read a Pro's remote interlock as satisfied
      while it is open
    - hv_enable (bit 4) is the readback of the HV_ENABLE output and
      never gates: neither state asserts anything

  Also covers the visibility policy (gfsw_visible / gfsw_edges): the
  door signal is hidden from the core while IDLE, JOG or HOMING and
  delivered the moment it is in any other state.
